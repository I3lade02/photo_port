              I'm a passionate photographer who finds beauty in everyday moments. Whether I'm capturing landscapes,
              portraits, or candid street scenes, I aim to tell authentic stories through light, texture, and emotion.
            </p>

              With a background in [your background here], I approach photography as both an art and a form of connection.
              My goal is to make viewers feel something â€” to pause, reflect, and see the world a little differently.
